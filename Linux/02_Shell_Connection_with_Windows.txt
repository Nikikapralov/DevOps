sudo apt-get install openssh-server = install openssh on the linux machine
sudo systemctl status ssh = check status if ssh connection is running

CMD
ssh -p 5522 name@localhost = connect to Linux machine from Windows PC

*Make sure there is a NAT connection between the VM and the Host Machine,
be sure to specify at which port, in our case port 22 TCP or 5522 for now.
