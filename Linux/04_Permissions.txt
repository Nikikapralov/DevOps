ls -l = check permissions 
*owner, group, public / rw = 6, r = 4, all = 7
sudo chown root:name file = change owner
sudo chmod 666 file = change permissions
-R = recursively to all files in dir

Exercises:
Create a few files:
touch file_1.txt file_2.txt file_3.py
ls -l
sudo chown root:root file_1.txt
ls -l
nano file_1.txt
sudo chown root:tervel file_1.txt
ls -l
nano file_1.txt
*write something in file now when the permissions are shared
sudo chmod 644 file_1.txt
ls -l
nano file_1.txt
*cannot access since permission was changed, grant permissions again
sudo chmod 666 file_1.txt
*grant permission to all files in a directory recursively
sudo chmod -R 777 ./
*change owner of all files in a dir recursively
sudo chown -R tervel:root ./
